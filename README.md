TODO
====

* Finish the implmentation of the Fruit class so that it prompts the user for
information, and fill the attributes of a Fruit object.

* Expand the Fruit class so that it implements CRUD operations in SQL. Check
that your records are being created correctly using the SQLite3 console.

* Add a method that allows a user to select from a list of options, and either
insert a fruit, list all fruits and delete a fruit.

* Don't forget to git commit after each significant change.
